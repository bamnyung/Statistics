### 2017-Fall [Introduction to Scientific Computing] Final Project

We implemented image denoising algorithm based on total variation minimization.
We referenced two papers below.

(1) Nonlinear total variation based noise removal algorithms by Leonid I. Rudin, Stanley Osher and Emad Fatemi.

(2) Modeling Textures with Total Variation Minimization and Oscillating Patterns in Image Processing Luminita A. Vese and Stanley J. Osher

You can check sample images denoised 그림1.png, 그림2.png, 그림3.png.
